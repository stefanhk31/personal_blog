## Introduction

This Dart contains the data models necessary to fetch and de-serialize blogs and display them on the client. Models are grouped into three categories:

1. `endpoint_models`: request/response models made for interacting directly with the API
2. `data_models`: core models containing key properties for blogs and associated entities
3. `presentation_models`: models made for displaying content on the client

This project also includes a `test_fixtures.dart` class to make testing easier in packages that consume this models package.
